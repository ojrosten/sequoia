# sequoia

[sequoia](https://ojrosten.github.io/sequoia/html/index.html) is a modern C++ library,
under active development, comprising a sophisticated
[testing framework](https://ojrosten.github.io/sequoia/html/dc/d92/testframeworkpage.html)
together with various mathematical abstractions, the most mature of which is a graph implementation.
The latter is useable in constant expressions, supporting traversals which may return compile-time constants.
