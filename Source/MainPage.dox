    \section intro_sec Introduction

    `sequoia` is a modern C++ library, under active development, presently comprising a sophisticated
    \ref testframeworkpage "testing framework" together with various mathematical abstractions,
	the most mature of which is a graph implementation.

    \subsection intro_name Why sequoia?

    The giant sequoia, <em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em>, has a remarkable ecology. Of particular relevance is that,
    despite their tremendous size as adults, young trees do not appear to grow particularly fast:
    significant resources are invested in
    growing thick, fireproof bark to protect their future. This has always served as an inspiration
    for the testing framework that underpins this library; also as a personal reminder when tempted
    with hacks! As they develop,
    giant sequoias pack their wood with tannins and, under the right conditions, can survive for thousands
    of years. As humanity ploughs headlong into a climate catastrophe driven, at least in part, by
    a collective inability to see beyond the short term, we would do well to learn from these
    magnificent organisms.
	
	\subsection intro_gpl Why the GNU Public License?
	
	I believe in free, open-source software. Software has an ever-increasing influence over our daily lives.
	My personal view is that software should, at an intrinsic level, be for everyone: without catches and
	with total transparency. 
	My greatest source of trepidation in making `sequoia` open-source is that of embarrassment: some of the code
	I've written is doubtless wrong, awful or both! However, if the price of transparency is my ego, then it is
	a small price to pay.
	
	If you would like to give something back, other than code, please consider donating to one
	of these charities.
